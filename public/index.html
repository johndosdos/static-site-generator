        <h1>Front-end Development is the Worst</h1>
        <p> Look, front-end development is for script kiddies and soydevs who
            can't handle the real programming. I mean, it's just a bunch of divs
            and spans, right? And css??? It's like, "Oh, I want this to be red,
            but not thaaaaat red." What a joke. </p>
        <p> Real programmers code, not silly markup languages. They code on Arch
            Linux, not Mac OS, and certainly not Windows. They use Vim, not VS
            Code. They use C, not HTML. Come to the <a
                href="https://www.boot.dev">backend</a>, where the real
            programming happens. </p>
